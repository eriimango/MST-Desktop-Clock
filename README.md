# MST-Desktop-Clock

<h1> Mountain Time Clock </h1>
<p> I created a Mountain Time clock. I'm currrently on EST time and I'm a virtual bootcamp student. 
  The bootcamp is in Denver, CO MST. It's hard to quickly keep up with the cohort schedule from
  different time zones so I created this tool that can be placed in the corner of my screen!
  In march I created a digital clock that collects the current time so I used that code and implemented IST
to convert it from my current timezone to MST. 
  Later I will add more features, but for now I needed it so I created it!</p>
